# Java-Neural-Net
The first neural network I made in java to understand neural network math without numpy

## Notes

Just a simple classifier that uses the iris dataset but implimented in java. Since I first wrote this program in python then transfered it to java, I needed the functions that could do what is done with numpy in python. So I created Netlibrary. It just has static methods that I will need for some of the matrix multiplication.
